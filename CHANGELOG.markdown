## Version 0.5 - Released March 11th, 2012 ##

You can download this release [here](https://github.com/downloads/iKenndac/500px-Aperture-Uploader/500px%20Aperture%20Uploader-Latest.zip). Installation instructions [here](https://github.com/iKenndac/500px-Aperture-Uploader/blob/master/README.markdown).

#### New Features ####

* Icon! Proving how bad I am at image editing.

* When trying to run the plugin when Aperture is in 32-bit mode, instructions are given on how to switch that off.

* If the combination of the selected image and Version Preset will give an image too small to sell on the 500px Store, the plugin will let you know.

* The plugin now (optionally) generates a detailed upload log with links to each uploaded photo and/or a detailed description of any failures that occur. This can be controlled in the plugin's preferences.

#### Bugs Fixed/Changes ####

* Error reporting when logging in (or failing, at least) is much better.

* The plugin now supports localisation in the standard Mac OS X way. If you know how to localise Mac stuff dig right in, otherwise if you'd like the plugin translated to your language get in contact and I can help you.


## Version 0.4 - Released February 21st, 2012 ##

You can download this release [here](https://github.com/downloads/iKenndac/500px-Aperture-Uploader/500px%20Aperture%20Uploader-0.4.zip). Installation instructions [here](https://github.com/iKenndac/500px-Aperture-Uploader/blob/master/README.markdown).

#### New Features ####

* Photo names now default to the "Title" field of a photo, if available. If not, "Version Name" will be used instead.

* The plugin will now automatically check for updates to itself. This can be switched off in Preferences. You can also manually check for updates.

* A Growl notification will be issued when the export completes. Clicking on it will take you to your 500px.com "You" page. Credit to Ash Furrow for this - thanks!

* When a photo is uploaded, the 500px.com URL for it is added to the photo's custom metadata under "500px URL". The plugin will then tell you when it sees a photo that's been previously uploaded and give you a button to go to it.

* About window to give credit where it's due.

#### Bugs Fixed ####

* None.
