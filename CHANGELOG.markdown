#### New Features ####

* Photo names now default to the "Title" field of a photo, if available. If not, "Version Name" will be used instead.

* The plugin will now automatically check for updates to itself. This can be switched off in Preferences. You can also manually check for updates.

* A Growl notification will be issued when the export completes. Clicking on it will take you to your 500px.com "You" page. Credit to Ash Furrow for this - thanks!

* When a photo is uploaded, the 500px.com URL for it is added to the photo's custom metadata under "500px URL". The plugin will then tell you when it sees a photo that's been previously uploaded and give you a button to go to it.

* About window to give credit where it's due.

#### Bugs Fixed ####

* None.
